It can be created in the following ways 1. Use `Addr::unchecked(input)` 2. Use `let checked: Addr = deps.api.addr_validate(input)?` 3. Use `let checked: Addr = deps.api.addr_humanize(canonical_addr)?` 4. Deserialize from JSON. This must only be done from JSON that was validated before such as a contract's state. `Addr` must not be used in messages sent by the user because this would result in unvalidated instances.\n\nThis type is immutable.

Are you sure?), create a mutable copy using `let mut mutable = Addr::to_string()` and operate on that `String` instance.","type":"string"},"AssetInfo":{"description":"This enum describes available Token types. ## Examples ``` # use cosmwasm_std::Addr; # use astroport::asset::AssetInfo::{NativeToken, Token}; Token { contract_addr: Addr::unchecked(\"terra...\") }; NativeToken { denom: String::from(\"uluna\") }; ```","oneOf":[{"description":"Non-native Token","type":"object","required":["token"],"properties":{"token":{"type":"object","required":["contract_addr"],"properties":{"contract_addr":{"$ref":"#/definitions/Addr"}}}},"additionalProperties":false},{"description":"Native token","type":"object","required":["native_token"],"properties":{"native_token":{"type":"object","required":["denom"],"properties":{"denom":{"type":"string"}}}},"additionalProperties":false}]},"AstroportConfig_for_String":{"type":"object","required":["coins","generator"],"properties":{"coins":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/definitions/AssetInfo"}},"generator":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false}}}
